# BetterPhotos Project

Thank you to Bytegrad for a great course. The project comes from his CSS course where we follow along and try to create what he does.

## What this project is

This project is for creating a frontend for the home page of a basic photography reviewing community web application. HTML5 was used for the structure, and SCSS with NodeJS scripts were used to speed up the programming process (i.e.: using nested `&_(...)` for easier access to classes, and then a Node and CSSO and PostCSS script to convert all SCSS to regular CSS with just a few CLI inputs).

## What I learned

- How to use SCSS
- How to use CSS Grid in tandem with Flexbox for a seamless user interface
- Animating with CSS Grid
- How to use NodeJS to speed up the process of converting SCSS to regular CSS
- How to make your CSS file more optimized (build folder, adding prefixes for old browsers)
